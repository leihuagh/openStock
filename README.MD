# OpenStock
A Data Visualization App for Stocks on the S&P 500 List.
Made using Node.js, PostGreSQL, ReactJS, ExpressJS
# Why?
Because I thought it would be cool to put my own implementation of the standard stock viewing app.
In the future I hope to make it a stock simulation in which users can make purchases of stocks.
Making it a fun and educational APP for people to use for their leisure.
